            My goal is to capture every moment that tells the story of your day. <br> <br>
            The big ones like the moment your eyes meet as you walk down the aisle for the first time.
            Your mom squeezing you tightly as she buttons up your dress. Your laughter as you whisper
            secrets to each other during your first dance. <br> <br>
            And the little ones that happen quietly in-between. Your dad clutching onto your hand when
            he sees you for the first time. Your maid of honor tearing up as you read your vows. Your
            grandpa's laughter as the jitter bug comes on and he rushes to the dance floor. Your mom
            sneaking your niece another piece of cake when no one is looking. <br> <br>
            I believe that your wedding photos should transport you back in time to remind you of all
            of the emotional moments you didn't realize you had forgotten.

            These are the moments that you want captured in perfect detail. Your wedding day goes
            by fast (trust me, I know from experience!), and you don't want to miss a single moment. <br> <br>
            I'm there from the beginning - at your engagement session where I can get to know you
            better and see how the two of you interact, on your wedding day during all of those
            emotional moments, and after, to share in your joy as you relive those moments all
            over again! <br> <br>
            If you want to look back on your wedding day and see the genuine laughter of the people
            you love, the emotional moments that brought tears to your eyes, and gorgeous couple's
            portraits that will make you swoon - I am your girl!
