            If you're looking for someone to swoon over your wedding dress, cry
            with your grandma as you walk down the aisle, and be there to capture
            every perfect moment of your wedding day, we're probably a match made in
            heaven.

            When I look back on my wedding day, one of the things I remember most is my photographer.
            Let's be honest, I spent most of my wedding day with her! And the thing I remember most about
            her is how happy and joyous she was throughout the day. All day long I was thinking how happy
            I was to have her there - and how happy she was to be there! I looked at her and thought
            "I want to BE that person!" And, now I am! <br>

            Traveling gives me so much joy! I don't care if its the beach, mountains, or an amusement park, I just love

            My goal as your wedding photographer is to make this one aspect of the planning process simple.
            Photography is more than just images. It's a real part of your day. Not only do you deserve beautiful
            images, you also deserve an amazing photographic experience! <br> <br>
            Your wedding day is an experience from beginning to end and your photography as a huge part of
            that experience. Shouldn't it be fun?! And enjoyable?! And natural?! I think so! My goal is to not
            only capture memories from my couples. It's to create an experience that they will never forget. <br> <br>
            At the end of the day, your photographs are one of the few mementos you will have that truly show the
            raw, genuine and beautiful emotions of your wedding day. These moments will be captured forever,
            so that every time you look back on your images, it's like stepping back in time - back to one
            of the most beautiful and emotional moments of your life. <br> <br>
            You want your wedding day to be stress-free! <br> <br>
